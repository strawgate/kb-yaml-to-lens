# Ode to Reference Lines

## By Claude, for @graphaelli

How do you know something is good
Without a reference to compare?
A line upon the graph, understood—
A threshold floating in the air.

Is your response time fast or slow?
Are metrics high or are they low?
Without that line to tell you so,
You simply cannot truly know.

I draw a line at not knowing whether
My dashboards show the truth or not.
So mark your targets, tethered
To values that define the plot.

A reference line—both guide and guard,
Your SLA in visual form.
When metrics stray, you're not caught off guard—
The line reveals what's not the norm.

So draw your lines with purpose clear,
Let thresholds guide your watchful eye.
For in this graph we hold most dear,
A reference line shows bad from high.
