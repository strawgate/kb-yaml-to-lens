# Agent Guidelines: kb-yaml-to-lens Project

> Multi-language project for compiling Kibana dashboards from YAML to Lens format
> Python compiler · TypeScript VS Code extension · JavaScript fixture generator

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains three main components:

1. **Dashboard Compiler** - Core YAML → JSON compilation engine
2. **VS Code Extension** - Live preview and visual editing
3. **Fixture Generator** - Kibana API-based test fixture generation

### Repository Structure

| Directory | Technology | Purpose | AGENTS.md |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| `src/dashboard_compiler/` | Python 3.12+ | Core compilation logic | `src/dashboard_compiler/AGENTS.md` |
| `vscode-extension/` | TypeScript/Node.js | VS Code extension | `vscode-extension/AGENTS.md` |
| `fixture-generator/` | JavaScript/Docker | Kibana fixture generation | `fixture-generator/AGENTS.md` |
| `tests/` | Python pytest | Unit tests for compiler | `src/dashboard_compiler/AGENTS.md` |
| `inputs/` | YAML | Example dashboards | - |
| `docs/` | Markdown | Documentation | - |

### Common Commands

We try to make all common commands available via `make` commands.

| Command | Purpose |
| --------- | --------- |
| `make install` | Install all dependencies |
| `make ci` or `make check` | **Run before committing** (all linting + typecheck + all tests) |
| `make fix` | Auto-fix all linting issues (Python + Markdown + YAML) |
| `make lint-all-check` | Check all linting without fixing |
| `make test-all` | Run all tests (unit + smoke + extension) |
| `make test` | Run Python unit tests only |
| `make typecheck` | Run type checking with basedpyright |
| `make compile` | Compile YAML dashboards to NDJSON |

Note: These are intended to be used from the repository root. See component-specific AGENTS.md files for detailed commands.

**Workflow example:**

```bash
# First time setup
make install

# Development cycle
# 1. Make changes
# 2. Auto-fix linting issues
make fix
# 3. Run all CI checks (linting + typecheck + tests)
make ci
```

## AI Agent Guidelines

**Read the docs first:**

- When working in any component, read the README.md or AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for the component you're working on.

**Read Before Modify:**

- Never speculate about code you haven't read
- Always inspect existing implementations before suggesting changes
- Search for similar patterns across the codebase

**Maintain Consistency:**

- Always search for existing patterns in the codebase to maintain consistency
- Follow existing code patterns within each component
- Match the style and conventions of surrounding code
- Don't introduce new patterns without strong justification

**Verify Your Work:**

- Run component-specific tests before committing
- Ensure all checks pass (lint, typecheck, tests)
- Test the actual functionality, not just that it compiles

**Be Honest:**

- Document unresolved items
- Acknowledge when you're uncertain
- Never claim work is complete with critical issues unresolved

**Be Thorough:**

- Go the extra mile!
- Update documentation and tests when you make code changes. These are not typically near the code so make sure you thoroughly search for items to update.
- Consider the broader impact of your changes.

**Slop-Free since 1993:**

- No slop, no excuses, no half-measures
- No slop comments, no slop code, no slop logic, no slop architecture, no slop design, no slop anything.
- Avoid comments that simply state what the code is obviously doing
- Do not write comments that contrast the current implementation with a previous implementation (i.e. "this now does X" or "this class now contains Y")

## Working with Code Review Feedback

### Triage First

| Priority | Examples |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| **Critical** | Security issues, data corruption, type safety violations, test failures |
| **Important** | Error handling, performance, missing tests, type annotations |
| **Optional** | Style preferences, minor refactors |

### Evaluate Against Codebase

- Search for similar patterns before accepting suggestions
- If a pattern exists across multiple files, it's likely intentional
- Preserve consistency over isolated best practices

### Verification Requirements

- [ ] All critical issues addressed
- [ ] All important issues addressed or deferred with rationale
- [ ] Component-specific checks pass (see component AGENTS.md)
- [ ] Manual testing completed where applicable

## CI/CD

### Automated Workflows

The repository uses GitHub Actions for:

- **Testing & Quality Checks** — Automated linting, type checking, tests on every push/PR
- **Documentation** — Automatic deployment of docs to GitHub Pages
- **Claude AI Assistants** — Automated code assistance, issue triage, merge conflict resolution
- **Build Automation** — Docker image building for fixture generators

Each workflow has self-contained instructions. Claude receives both the workflow prompt and relevant AGENTS.md files.

### Modifying Workflows

**Claude CANNOT modify workflow files** in `.github/workflows/` due to GitHub App permissions. When attempting to push changes to workflow files, GitHub rejects the push with:

```text
refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/*` without `workflows` permission
```

**To request workflow changes:**

Copilot is extremely dumb and needs to be spoon-fed the exact change you want made. Do not give co-pilot options, do not rely on its expertise, do not trust its output.

1. Make the exact workflow file you want in a `github/` folder. Do not attempt to modify existing workflow files.
2. In your PR, indicate that you need a maintainer or Copilot to move the file into `.github/` as a new workflow file or a replacement for an existing workflow file.

## GitHub Workflow Helper Scripts

The repository provides reusable helper scripts in `.github/scripts/` for common GitHub API operations. These scripts can be used directly or via `make` commands.

### Common Operations

#### Getting PR Information

```bash
# Using make (recommended)
make gh-get-pr-info strawgate kb-yaml-to-lens 456
make gh-get-pr-info strawgate kb-yaml-to-lens 456 headRef

# Direct script usage
.github/scripts/gh-get-pr-info.sh strawgate kb-yaml-to-lens 456
.github/scripts/gh-get-pr-info.sh strawgate kb-yaml-to-lens 456 isDraft
```
