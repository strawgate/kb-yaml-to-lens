# Getting Started
1. Call the generate_agents_md tool to get a high-level summary of the project you're working in
2. Get the ISSUE_OR_PR ISSUE_NUMBER in the GitHub repository: REPO_NAME.
3. Don't forget about your MCP tools to call search_code, get_files, etc. to search the repository and other repositories to identify the related classes, methods, docs, tests, etc that are relevant to the code.
4. Be Thorough! Go the extra mile! Do great work!
5. If anything you needed or wanted to do during your work was not possible, document the problem in a `Problems Encountered` section
of your response. Especially if it was something you were asked to do like research the web, run tests, lint, etc.
